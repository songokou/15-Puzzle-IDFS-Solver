This program is written in Java. This program solves the 15-puzzle using BFS and iterative deepening depth-first search. It supports two goal states
0 1 2 3 		1 2 3 4
4 5 6 7			5 6 7 8
8 9 A B			9 A B C
C D E F			D E F 0

The BFS version of code is written in Solver class and IDFS is written in DFSolver. 

You could change your file input in Puzzle class where main function is. 

Examples of input are given in the main. You could run the BFS by commenting DFSolver and vice versa.

After changing the input puzzle in main, compile all files by “javac *.java”. Then run the program by “java Puzzle”. Or you can simply put all files in the default package in Eclipse and click Run.
